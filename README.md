## üöÄ Project Overview

This project uses **pure SQL** to answer practical business questions faced by e-commerce companies. From identifying unprofitable products to analyzing the effect of returns and shipping delays, the project reveals data-driven insights that can drive better business decisions.

All queries were written in MySQL-style syntax and can be run inside a SQL environment, or adapted into a Jupyter Notebook using `sqlite3` or `pandasql`.

## Key Business Questions Answered

‚úÖ Which products and categories are **consistently unprofitable**?  
‚úÖ How do **discounts impact profit margins** across orders?  
‚úÖ Are **certain shipping modes** causing more **delivery delays**?  
‚úÖ What is the **return rate**, and how do returns affect profitability?  
‚úÖ Are **certain customer segments or product categories** more likely to return products?  
‚úÖ Who are the **top 10 customers by total sales and profit**?  
‚úÖ What are the **monthly and quarterly trends** in sales and profits over time?  
‚úÖ How profitable is each **customer segment**?  
‚úÖ Can we track **dynamic KPIs** like return rate, delivery delay rate, and profit margin across segments?

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Techniques Used

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Aggregations & GROUP BY**
- **Date Functions (YEAR, MONTH, QUARTER, DATEDIFF)**
- **Conditional Logic with CASE**
- **Windowing Metrics like profit margin, return rate, delay rate**
- **NULLIF for safe division (avoiding zero division errors)**

---

## Sample Insights

- Some product categories (especially high-discounted ones) contribute **negatively to overall profit**.
- **Returns** significantly reduce profit margins in the Consumer segment.
- **Standard Class** shipping method has the highest **average shipping delay**.
- Most **profitable customer segment**: Corporate.  
- **Quarter 4** is consistently the highest in terms of **sales volume**.
- Customers in certain **regions consistently return more products**, increasing logistical overhead.
